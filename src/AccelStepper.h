/// \class AccelStepper AccelStepper.h <AccelStepper.h>
/// \brief Support for stepper motors with acceleration etc.
///
/// This defines a single 2 or 4 pin stepper motor, or stepper moter with fdriver chip, with optional
/// acceleration, deceleration, absolute positioning commands etc. Multiple
/// simultaneous steppers are supported, all moving 
/// at different speeds and accelerations. 
///
/// \par Operation
/// This module operates by computing a step time in microseconds. The step
/// time is recomputed after each step and after speed and acceleration
/// parameters are changed by the caller. The time of each step is recorded in
/// microseconds. The run() function steps the motor once if a new step is due.
/// The run() function must be called frequently until the motor is in the
/// desired position, after which time run() will do nothing.
///
/// \par Positioning
/// Positions are specified by a signed long integer. At
/// construction time, the current position of the motor is consider to be 0. Positive
/// positions are clockwise from the initial position; negative positions are
/// anticlockwise. The current position can be altered for instance after
/// initialization positioning.
///
/// \par Caveats
/// This is an open loop controller: If the motor stalls or is oversped,
/// AccelStepper will not have a correct 
/// idea of where the motor really is (since there is no feedback of the motor's
/// real position. We only know where we _think_ it is, relative to the
/// initial starting point).
///
/// \par Performance
/// The fastest motor speed that can be reliably supported is about 4000 steps per
/// second at a clock frequency of 16 MHz on Arduino such as Uno etc. 
/// Faster processors can support faster stepping speeds. 
/// However, any speed less than that
/// down to very slow speeds (much less than one per second) are also supported,
/// provided the run() function is called frequently enough to step the motor
/// whenever required for the speed set.
/// Calling setAcceleration() is expensive,
/// since it requires a square root to be calculated.
///
/// Gregor Christandl reports that with an Arduino Due and a simple test program, 
/// he measured 43163 steps per second using runSpeed(), 
/// and 16214 steps per second using run();
